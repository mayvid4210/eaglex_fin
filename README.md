**⚡ EagleX — Real-Time Motorsport Intelligence Dashboard**

EagleX is a high-frequency telemetry system that converts raw physics data into clear, actionable racing insights.

It is built around three core layers:

**1️) Mechanical Intelligence (MHE)**

+ High-level engineering indicators:

+ Mechanical Health %

+ Time to Critical

+ DNF Probability

+ Service Load & Repair Priority

+ Failure Curves (Weibull-based projections)

**2️) Live Physics Stream**

+ Continuously updated real-time physics signals:

+ Tire Wear

+ Brake Rotor Temp

+ Energy Consumption

+ Aero Drag Variation

+ Suspension Travel + Bottom-Outs

+ Battery SOC

+ Lap-Time Delta

+ Slip Ratio

+ G-Force & Shock Events

+ Wind Effect

+ Cornering Grip Temperature

+ Aggression Factor / Risk Index

**3️) Event Detection Layer**

+ Raw physics → engineering alerts:

+ Thermal Surge

+ Brake Fade / Cavitation

+ Sensor Drift

+ Bottom-Out

+ Curb Abuse

+ Severe Shock

+ Aero Stall

+ Wheel Lock
